# Medical PDF AI Assistant

## Overview

I've been experimenting with a few separate PDF handling and generative AI apps, and now Iâ€™m combining the individual components into a single project.

This app lets users:

* Upload a **medical document in PDF format**.
* Have the PDF **summarized by generative AI**.
* Ask **questions about the document**, which the AI will answer.
* Handle PDFs **with or without embedded text**. Scanned documents or photos taken with a mobile camera will be processed using **optical text recognition (OCR)**.
* Copy **extracted text** to the clipboard.

Think of it as a personal assistant for understanding medical PDFs quickly.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js
* **Frontend:** React
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **PDF Processing:** PDF parsing + OCR for scanned documents
* **AI Integration:** Generative AI for summaries and Q\&A
